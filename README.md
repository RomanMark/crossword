The empty puzzle will be a string with the following rules:

1. Each character will be either a number, a `.` or a `\n`;
2. A number represents the number of words starting from the specific position and a `.` represents a space that does not need to be filled.

If the puzzle or list of words provided as inputs does not guarantee a unique solution, or any other conditions stated above are not met, the function must print `Error`.
